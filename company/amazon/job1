DESCRIPTION

Over $30 billion dollars will be spent on advertising this year, and Amazon is investing heavily in building a world class advertising business. Amazon Sponsored Products is responsible for defining and delivering a collection of self-service performance advertising products that drive discovery and sales. Our products are strategically important to our Retail and Marketplace businesses driving long term growth. We deliver billions of ad impressions and millions of clicks daily and are breaking fresh ground to create world-class products. With a broad mandate to experiment and innovate, we are growing at an unprecedented rate with a seemingly endless range of new opportunities.

As ads become a core part of the shopping experience on Amazon, we're investing heavily in making sure we’re showing the best ads. At the heart of the ad selection process are machine-learned predictive models. We use them to predict what ads will be clicked, what clicks will lead to sales and how these will have second-order effects on other customer interaction on the site. We have world class research teams that are continually working to improve these predictive models.

Our Model Builder team is working on a scalable, robust and extensible platform to automate production usage of machine learning models, enable the research teams to experiment with new ideas quickly, and reduce the time between experimentation and production. We work closely with researchers on cutting edge technologies.

Come join us! In this role, you will design, implement, test, document and deliver scale and extensible platforms and tools using Object Oriented programming, distributed programming, Java and more. You will gather and analyze business and functional requirements, and translate requirements into technical specifications for robust, scalable, supportable solutions. You will involve in the full development cycle, end-to-end, from conception, design, implementation and testing to documentation, delivery and maintenance. As the ideal candidate, you have excellent problem-solving skills, and a customer-focused mindset. You take pragmatic and iterative approach to building software: you have an ability to simplify and get things done with a demonstrated track record of building and delivering software and working effectively with external and internal teams.
