Q: A[m,n], A[0,0] -> A[m-1, n-1],  RIGHT, DOWN
MAX-PRODUCT


F[m][n] : 从[0][0]走到[m][n]的 max-product


F1[m][n]
F2[m][n]


Extra space:
Consider overflow
Started from any cell in first row, ended at any cell in last row 
LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN, once


F[i][j] = f[i-1][j], f[i][j-1], f[i][j+1]


F[n][m]



-1 3 7 9
2 6 -2 1
5 -3 8 7
2 4 9 -2




A[0,2].max=63
A[0,2].min=-21


A[0,3].max=63*9
A[0,3].min=-21

===============

问了我个图的问题。给我了一组输入
"a<b", "b<c", "c<a", 问是否是合法输入。我分析后是转化成图做，看有向图是否有环。

Implement Conways Game of Life.
For a 2D m by n rectangular grid, each cell can be on or off. 
Each cell updates based on its eight neighbours. 
If 2 neighbours are on, the state remains the same. 
If 3 neighbours are on, the state becomes on. 
Otherwise the state becomes off. 
All cells should behave as if updated simultaneously. //
The grid should be toroidally mapped, such that looking off the right edge sees the left edge, vice versa, and top to bottom.

//////
Given a word, find the minimum number of steps required to convert word to a word with SS pattern. (each operation is counted as 1 step.)
e.g : cdcc -> cdcd  或者 ccc ->cc

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:
a) Insert a character
b) Delete a character
c) Replace a character
