What if your job description were simply? Make tomorrow better? That’s the essence of roles within our Bing Team. Every day, we bring an insatiable curiosity to the table, challenging ourselves to reimagine what is and what can be. We build on what’s to come before to create what’s next. We drive machine intelligence. We help shape the future. We empower billions of people around the globe.   The emergence of online services has extended web as an information repository to where users can take actions and complete tasks end to end, such as buying movie tickets, reserving a restaurant table, borrowing books, and getting a taxi.

This trend is accelerated by the mobile devices, equipped with the mobile web to keep user always online, multiple sensors to extend user inputs from texts to speech, images, location and connect online to offline, cloud computation to enable intelligent inferences and large scale data mining, and native apps to deliver compelling user experiences. With this, search engine & apps’s role is to connect people with services, turn intentions into actions lightning fast, and eventually make your mobile devices as your personal task assistant.   

For this purpose, our team (Bing app linking and task completion team) is actively hiring talented and solid engineers to work on the following:
- Discovering and indexing services on the web and within native apps.
- Understanding the intents of services as actions they enable and entities they act upon, via machine learning and big data analysis techniques.
- Detecting task intents from user queries & contexts, finding and deep launching relevant web/app services with corresponding task parameters.
- Enabling app-to-app linking via intents for close loop task completion. 
- Shipping task completion features via web/app services on bing.com, Cortana, Bing search apps on iOS/Android, IE/Office/Skype/etc. and external search API.   

Desired Skills & Qualifications Include:
- 5+ years programming experiences in C++/C#.
