Hi Wang,

I have some great news, Amazon Japan has reviewed your application and they 
have confirmed that they would like to proceed to a 1st interview.

The interview will be approximately 60 minutes long and will be with one of 
the current Software Development Engineers at Amazon Japan.

Below I have included the dates which the interviewer will be free. Please 
let me know all your availabilities to ensure a time that matches. The 
interviewer is only available from 9am to 6pm Japanese Standard Time (JST), 
I understand this may not be of convenience to you, but I do really 
appreciate your cooperation with this.

Monday November 21st 【 JST】 
Tuesday November 22nd 【 JST】
Thursday November 24th 【 JST】
Friday November 25th 【 JST】

I will try to arrange for an interview as early as possible from the times 
you provide to make sure this process is as quick as possible. :)

For the interview, please prepare a PC with internet connection and Amazon 
will send you the link for shared white board to write code.

Amazon only interview people they are very seriously considering hiring and 
as a result they’ve requested you to fill in a Non-Disclosure Agreement 
(NDA) and Questionnaire (find attached to this document). Please fill in 
the questionnaire and send it back. Regarding the NDA, please print it out, 
sign it and send me a picture or scan it and send it back (whatever is 
easier).

If you have any questions, I am here to help, please feel free to ask.
Once again congratulations, I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best Regards,
